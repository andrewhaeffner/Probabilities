# Probabilities

These probabilistic simulation scripts are programs written as my solutions to select exercises in [this](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/amsbook.mac.pdf) Intro to Probability textbook. Fun stuff.

Each script is meant to be run in isolation. Numpy and Matplotlib are required libraries.

Any script can be ran simply with ```python3 <file_name>.py```.
