# Exercise 3
#
# Estimate the area of a circle of radius 1/2
# with center at (1/2,1/2) inside the unit
# square by choosing 1000 points at random.
# Compare your results with the true value of
# pi/4. Use your results to estimate pi.


# Exercise 4
#
# Estimate area under the graph of y = sin(pi x)
# inside the unit square by choosing 10K points
# at random. Estimate pi.

# Exercise 5
#
# Estimate the area under the graph of
# y = 1/(x+1) in the unit square in the same
# way as E4. Calculate the true value of this
# area and use the simulation to estimate the
# value of log 2.
